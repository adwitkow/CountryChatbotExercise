# CountryChatbotExercise

A small recruitment exercise regarding web development. Beware - during the development, corners were cut due to the lack of time.

## Requirements:
1.	Frontend - Implement a simple chatbot interface that contains:
    -	Message input
    -	Message history window
    -	Additional useful elements
2.	Backend - Implement a simple chatbot API that allows to:
    -	Initiate the conversation with the bot
    -	Send a message to and receive the answer from the bot
    -	Keep the conversation history throughout the session
    -	End the conversation
3.	Client-Server Communication â€“ Integrate with public API
    -	Allow the user to ask the bot about a particular Country by providing its name
    -	Query the public API: https://restcountries.eu/ for the result
    -	Provide the user with basic information about the Country (e.g. capital, population, etc.) through the bot interface
